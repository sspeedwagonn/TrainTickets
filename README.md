# TrainTickets

TrainTickets is a train ticket reservation system written in C. It allows users to:

- Log into their account
- Purchase or refund tickets
- Check train statuses
- Participate in a "Frequent Rider" program in which they can earn increasing discounts with more trips

This project is intended to keep me sharp with the foundations of C programming.
