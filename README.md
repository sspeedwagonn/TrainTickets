# TrainTickets

TrainTickets is a train ticket reservation system written in C. It allows users to:
- Sign-Up or log into their account
- Purchase or refund tickets
- Check train statuses
- Participate in a "Frequent Rider" program in which they can earn increasing discounts with more trips
- Add trains from available fleet (Admin only)

It also permits unlimited sign-ups and requires unique usernames! Future goal is to start associating users with their tickets as well as a "credit balance" for a more realistic user experience.
